          <h2>Overview</h2>
          
          
          <p>
            Academic stress is defined as the body's response to academic-related demands that exceed adaptive capabilities of students. 2. It is estimated that 10–30% of students experience some degree of academic stress during their academic career.
<br>
            The four components of academic stress usually identifiable in a student are academic frustration, academic conflicts, academic anxieties and academic pressures.
<br>
            
            Data: More than 1 in 3 high school students had experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness in 2019, a 40 percent increase since 2009. In 2019, approximately 1 in 6 youth reported making a suicide plan in the past year, a 44% increase since 2009. <br>
            According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIHM), adolescent depression in schools is on the rise. Here are some 2016 statistics from NIMH. <br>
            •	An estimated 3.1 million adolescents aged 12 to 17 in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in 2016. This number represents 12.8 percent of the US population in that age group. <br>
            •	More females than males experienced a major depressive episode in 2016 (19.4 percent of females vs. 6.4 percent of males). <br>
            •	That year, an estimated 2.2 million American adolescents aged 12 to 17 had at least one major depressive episode with severe impairment. <br>
            •	Only 19 percent of these teens received care from a health professional. <br>

        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>The key to success is to think positively. Take control of your stress and anxiety by learning effective techniques to combat it. Relaxing bodily tension in order to reduce the physical sensations of stress is a good place to start. If your body is free of tension, your mind tends to be relaxed. This helps you concentrate and study, take decisions and solve problems. When you are relaxed, you can view each task as a positive challenge, and use stress as a stimulus to help you carry it out, giving you a relaxing glow of achievement afterwards.</p>
        <p>Look after Yourself: Be kind to yourself. Give yourself “me time” in which you can choose what you want to do. Rest. Do nothing. Try a relaxation technique, massage or yoga. Have a long hot bath. Spend time with friends. Treat yourself to something special. Taking proper breaks and eating well do help to combat stress.</p>
        <p>Confront The Problem: Try to stand back and look at the problem carefully. Break it down into manageable parts. Talk it through with someone else, brainstorm solutions, or get help if you need it. Try to manage your time effectively and learn to say “No”.  Avoidance will not make the problem go away and can often make it worse. Leaving everything to the last minute is a major source of stress to students. Think about why you are finding it hard to get started – uncertainty about how to do the assignment, fear of being judged, or fear of failing? Starting a piece of work effectively reduces stress levels as it frees your mind, putting the thoughts of failure back into perspective. If you have had a row or a misunderstanding with someone, it rarely helps to avoid the issue. Talking it through with the other person or with someone outside the situation often helps you express your feelings, regain a sense of proportion, and identify a way of resolving the differences.</p>
        <p>Find Some Distraction: Sport and physical activity helps you to relax physically and also releases endorphins in the body which produce a real feeling of well being.   Walk, cycle, swim, join the Sports centre, or a sports team. Joining a club or society, maintaining an existing hobby or learning something new, talking to other people – can all help you to take a mental and physical break.</p>
        <p>Express Yourself: Talk about it, write about it, shout or moan about it. Expressing your feelings can help to relieve stress. Acknowledging a problem to yourself and others can be the first step in dealing with it. Sometimes having a good cry can release emotional pressure and calm your feelings of anxiety.</p>
